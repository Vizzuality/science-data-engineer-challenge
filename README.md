# Data Engineer Challenge

## What is the purpose of this challenge?
With this challenge we would like to see a little bit more how you work and the way you make decisions, specifically, the challenge will help us see:

* your current technical knowledge
* your thought process
* the way you work and organize

The challenge will also help you get a glimpse of the real type of technical work we develop on our daily basis and the type of datasets we work with.

Please feel-free to surprise us, and showcase any skills that you think are important!.

Keep in mind that there is no right or wrong answer. If you feel like your process isn't perfect, don't worry. This is just
meant to be an exercise to help us gauge where you are in terms of your current capacity and be a talking-point during the interview.

## The challenge

### Overview

The challenge consists in creating a data pipeline that takes a raster dataset, summarizes it by administrative regions and stores the results in a medium that allows queries (a relational database or columnar oriented file). Specifically we want to summarize the total carbon stock using the datasets generated by the National Forest Carbon Monitoring System of the USA for the states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota.

### The data:

- We want you to use a raster from the National Forest Carbon Monitoring System. Specifically, we will focus on current state of the northern lake states region.
The data and metadata can be downloaded from: https://usfs-public.box.com/shared/static/v861gwms9fq68sitl0r3vs2v3moxeu9x.zip

- Use any administrative boundary source for USA counties you fancy.

### The challenge question

Summarize the total ecosystem carbon per county in the states Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The result must be stored in a database like system capable of evaluating SQL-like queries.

### The tools
Use whatever tools you are comfortable with but it must include some parts written in Python.

## How should I deliver the results?
We Make a repository in your preferred git platform and share a link to that repository with us.

## How much time should I spend?
There is no time limit but we wouldn't want you to spend more than 5~6 hours out of respect of your free time.

## What if I have questions?
Email us any questions and we will answer as soon as possible

## What will happen in the interview?
* In the upcoming interview weâ€™ll focus on your coding challenge submission. We will **expect you to explain your code** to an audience that will include members of the Science team but also one or two people from other functional areas (Design, Front-End, Back-End, Project Manager,..). We will ask you any clarifying questions we might have.
* This will be an opportunity for you to provide some more context about the challenge, the assumptions you made, and add anything that you might want. The technical solution is not the only thing that we value, also your approach and explanations.
* Finally, we will also allocate some time for you to ask any questions about anything and everything you would like to know more about (ie. role, how we work at Vizzuality, our culture, benefits, etc.)
* The interview will last 120 minutes (max)
