# Data Engineer @ Vizzuality Challenge

## What is the purpose of this challenge?
With this challenge we would like to see a little bit more how you work and the way you make decisions, specifically, the challenge will help us see:

* your current technical knowledge
* your thought process
* the way you work and organize

The challenge will also help you get a glimpse of the real type of technical work we develop on our daily basis and the type of datasets we work with.

Please feel-free to surprise us, and showcase any skills that you think are important!.

Keep in mind that there is no right or wrong answer. If you feel like your process isn't perfect, don't worry. This is just
meant to be an exercise to help us gauge where you are in terms of your current capacity and be a talking-point during the interview.

## The challenge

### Overview

The challenge consists in creating a data pipeline that takes a raster dataset, summarizes it by administrative regions and stores the results in a relational database.Specifically, we want to summarize the **total ecosystem carbon** of the northern lakes region in the USA using the data of the National Forest Carbon Monitoring System.

The result must be a database with the total carbon values for each county of the states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota. To achieve it, we want you to create a simple Python pipeline that loads the rasters, computes the zonal stats and loads the values to the db.

### Data

- [Total ecosystem carbon raster from the National Forest Carbon Monitoring System](https://usfs-public.box.com/shared/static/v861gwms9fq68sitl0r3vs2v3moxeu9x.zip).

- Use any administrative boundary source for USA counties you think is appropriate.

### Objectives

- Deliver a simple and reproducible python data pipeline.
- The pipeline must be easily reproducible end to end. This means that all the setup instructions or programs must be part of the deliverable.
- The results must be accurate and correct (watch out the units, there are some clues in the metadata documents.)
- Include instructions on how to query the results and after executing the pipeline we must be able to do such queries.

#### Optional Goals

If you want to go an extra mile and surprise us

- Share an initial exploration of the input datasets with some visualization in a notebook or similar medium.
- A Map the results.
- Do you think something is missing/you can add useful features? Go for it!

### Tools
Apart from Python, use any tools you are comfortable with.

### Things to keep in mind

- Be pragmatic and mindful of the trade-off between feature-completeness and complexity/performance. Completeness is better than show-offs. Keep it simple.
- About the use of AI assistance, as with any other tool, we do allow you to use it. Nonetheless we expect that the delivered project is owned by you on its totality and that you understand
and are capable of defending all the aspects of your decisions. We want to know how you approached the problem, not how an LLM does it so keep them contained an under your control.

## How should I deliver the results?
As a link to a reproducible and self contained repository on your preferred git platform (GitHub, GitLab, Codeberg...)

## How much time should I spend?
There is no time limit but we wouldn't want you to spend more than ~6 hours.

## What if I have questions?
Email us any questions and we will answer as soon as possible

## What will happen in the interview?
* In the upcoming interview weâ€™ll focus on your coding challenge submission. We will **expect you to explain your code** to an audience that will include members of the Science team but also one or two people from other functional areas (Design, Front-End, Back-End, Project Manager,..). We will ask you any clarifying questions we might have.
* This will be an opportunity for you to provide some more context about the challenge, the assumptions you made, and add anything that you might want. The technical solution is not the only thing that we value, also your approach and explanations.
* Finally, we will also allocate some time for you to ask any questions about anything and everything you would like to know more about (ie. role, how we work at Vizzuality, our culture, benefits, etc.)
* The interview will last at most 120 minutes.
