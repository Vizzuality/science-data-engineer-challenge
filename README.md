# Data Engineer Challenge

## What is the purpose of this challenge?
With this challenge we would like to see a little bit more how you work and the way you make decisions, specifically, the challenge will help us see:

* your current technical knowledge
* your thought process
* the way you work and organize

The challenge will also help you get a glimpse of the real type of technical work we develop on our daily basis and the type of datasets we work with.

Please feel-free to surprise us, and showcase any skills that you think are important!.

Keep in mind that there is no right or wrong answer. If you feel like your analysis isn't perfect, don't worry. This is just
meant to be an exercise to help us gauge where you are in terms of your current capacity
and be a talking-point during the interview. A poor analysis will not necessarily
disqualify you from the job.

Email us any questions and we will answer as soon as possible

## What will happen in the interview?
* In the upcoming interview weâ€™ll focus on your coding challenge submission. We will **expect you to explain your code** to an audience that will include members of the Science team but also one or two people from other functional areas (Design, Front-End, Back-End, Project Manager,..). We will ask you any clarifying questions we might have.
* This will be an opportunity for you to provide some more context about the challenge, the assumptions you made, and add anything that you might want. The technical solution is not the only thing that we value, also your approach and explanations.
* Finally, we will also allocate some time for you to ask any questions about anything and everything you would like to know more about (ie. role, how we work at Vizzuality, our culture, benefits, etc.)
* The interview will last 120 minutes (max)
